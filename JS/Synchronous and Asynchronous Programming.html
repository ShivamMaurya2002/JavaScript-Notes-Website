    <h1>Difference Between Synchronous and Asynchronous Programming</h1>
    <p>
        Synchronous and asynchronous programming are two approaches to handling tasks in programming, particularly in JavaScript. 
        Understanding the difference between these approaches is crucial for efficient code execution.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Synchronous Programming</h2>
    <p>
        In synchronous programming, tasks are executed sequentially. Each task must complete before the next one starts.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Synchronous Example:-
console.log("Task 1");
console.log("Task 2");
console.log("Task 3");
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Output: Tasks 1, 2, and 3 are executed in order.</p>

    <h2>2. Asynchronous Programming</h2>
    <p>
        In asynchronous programming, tasks can start and run independently, allowing other tasks to execute without waiting for the previous task to finish.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Asynchronous Example:-
console.log("Task 1");
setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Task 2 (Delayed)");
}, 2000);
console.log("Task 3");
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Output: Task 1 and Task 3 are executed immediately, while Task 2 is delayed.</p>

    <h2>Key Differences</h2>
    <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="10">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>Synchronous Programming</th>
                <th>Asynchronous Programming</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Execution Order</td>
                <td>Tasks are executed one after another.</td>
                <td>Tasks can be executed out of order.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Blocking</td>
                <td>Blocks further execution until the current task is complete.</td>
                <td>Does not block further execution; other tasks can proceed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Performance</td>
                <td>Slower for tasks that involve waiting (e.g., file I/O, network).</td>
                <td>Faster for tasks involving waiting as other tasks are not delayed.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Synchronous programming is simple and predictable, but it can lead to inefficiency in scenarios involving delays. Asynchronous programming, 
        on the other hand, enables better performance and responsiveness in applications, particularly in web development and APIs.
