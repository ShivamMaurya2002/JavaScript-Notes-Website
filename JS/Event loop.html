    <h1>What Is the Event Loop in JavaScript?</h1>
    <p>
        The event loop is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allows asynchronous operations to be handled. 
        It continuously monitors the call stack and the task queue, ensuring non-blocking behavior in JavaScript's single-threaded environment.
    </p>

    <h2>How the Event Loop Works</h2>
    <p>
        The event loop enables JavaScript to execute code, collect and process events, and run queued tasks in an orderly manner. 
        It ensures that tasks in the call stack are completed before executing tasks from the task queue.
    </p>

    <h2>Example: Event Loop in Action</h2>
    <p>
        The following example demonstrates the working of the event loop:
    </p>
    <pre><code>
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Inside setTimeout");
}, 0);

console.log("End");
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Output: Start, End, Inside setTimeout</p>

    <h2>Key Points to Remember</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The call stack handles synchronous operations, while the task queue handles asynchronous tasks.</li>
        <li>Tasks in the task queue are executed only after the call stack is empty.</li>
        <li>Asynchronous operations like <code>setTimeout</code>, Promises, and events rely on the event loop to execute their callbacks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The event loop is essential for managing JavaScript's asynchronous behavior. 
        It ensures the efficient execution of code by coordinating the call stack and task queue, allowing JavaScript to handle multiple tasks smoothly in a single-threaded environment.
