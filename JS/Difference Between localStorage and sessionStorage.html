    <h1>Difference Between localStorage and sessionStorage in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> are two types of web storage that allow you to store data in a web browser. Both are part of the HTML5 Web Storage API, but they differ in their lifespan and scope.
    </p>

    <h2>1. localStorage</h2>
    <p>
        <code>localStorage</code> allows you to store data with no expiration time. The data will persist even after the browser is closed and reopened, making it useful for storing information that should be available across sessions.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Storing data in localStorage
localStorage.setItem("username", "JohnDoe");

// Retrieving data from localStorage
let username = localStorage.getItem("username");
console.log(username);  // Output: JohnDoe
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Note: The data stored in <code>localStorage</code> does not expire and is available until explicitly deleted.</p>

    <h2>2. sessionStorage</h2>
    <p>
        <code>sessionStorage</code> is used to store data for the duration of the page session. The data is available as long as the browser tab remains open. Once the tab is closed, the data is cleared.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
// Storing data in sessionStorage
sessionStorage.setItem("sessionID", "12345");

// Retrieving data from sessionStorage
let sessionID = sessionStorage.getItem("sessionID");
console.log(sessionID);  // Output: 12345
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Note: The data stored in <code>sessionStorage</code> is only available for the duration of the page session and is cleared once the tab is closed.</p>

    <h2>3. Key Differences</h2>
    <table border="1" cellpadding="10">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Feature</th>
                <th>localStorage</th>
                <th>sessionStorage</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Data Persistence</td>
                <td>Persists even after the browser is closed.</td>
                <td>Data is cleared once the tab or browser is closed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Scope</td>
                <td>Accessible across all windows/tabs in the same browser.</td>
                <td>Accessible only in the same window/tab during the session.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Data Capacity</td>
                <td>Typically 5MB per domain.</td>
                <td>Typically 5MB per domain (same as localStorage).</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>4. When to Use</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Use <code>localStorage</code>:</strong> When you need to store data that should persist across sessions, such as user preferences, themes, or authentication tokens.</li>
        <li><strong>Use <code>sessionStorage</code>:</strong> When you need to store data for a single session, like a shopping cart that disappears after the user closes the tab or page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        <code>localStorage</code> and <code>sessionStorage</code> are both essential tools in modern web development, allowing you to store data in the browser. Understanding their differences will help you choose the right one based on your needsâ€”whether you need persistent data storage or session-specific data storage.
