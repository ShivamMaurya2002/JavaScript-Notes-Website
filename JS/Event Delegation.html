    <h1>What Is Event Delegation and Why Is It Useful?</h1>
    <p>
        Event delegation is a technique in JavaScript where you attach a single event listener to a parent element instead of multiple event listeners to individual child elements. The parent element listens for events triggered by its child elements and responds accordingly.
    </p>

    <h2>1. How Event Delegation Works</h2>
    <p>
        In event delegation, the parent element listens for events on its children through event bubbling. When an event is triggered on a child element, it "bubbles" up the DOM tree to the parent. The parent can then check if the event target matches the desired child element and handle it.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
document.querySelector("#parent").addEventListener("click", function(event) {
    if (event.target && event.target.matches("button")) {
        console.log("Button clicked:", event.target.textContent);
    }
});
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Output: Logs the button text when a button inside the parent container is clicked.</p>

    <h2>2. Why Is Event Delegation Useful?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Improved Performance:</strong> Instead of adding event listeners to each individual child element, you only need to add one listener to the parent. This reduces memory usage and improves performance, especially when there are many child elements.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic Content:</strong> Event delegation is especially useful when working with dynamically added content. New child elements added to the parent will automatically trigger the parent's event listener without needing to manually attach new listeners to them.</li>
        <li><strong>Cleaner Code:</strong> By consolidating event listeners on the parent, your code becomes more organized and easier to maintain.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        Event delegation is a powerful and efficient technique for handling events in JavaScript, especially when dealing with dynamic content or large sets of elements. It simplifies event management and enhances performance by minimizing the number of event listeners attached to individual elements.
