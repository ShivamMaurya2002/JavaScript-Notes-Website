    <h1>Fibonacci Series in JavaScript</h1>
    <p>
        The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1.
        The series looks like this: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and so on.
    </p>

    <h2>Using JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        Below is an example of generating the Fibonacci series up to a given number using a <code>for</code> loop.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
const num = 10;

let num1 = 0, num2 = 1;

console.log("Fibonacci Series up to " + num + " terms:");

for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
    console.log(num1);  
    let num3 = num1 + num2; 
    num1 = num2; 
    num2 = num3;  
}
    </code></pre>
    <p class="example">Output: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34</p>

    <h2>Explanation</h2>
    <p>
        - The first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are initialized as <code>num1 = 0</code> and <code>num2 = 1</code>.<br>
        - In each iteration, the current number (<code>num1</code>) is printed.<br>
        - The next number in the sequence is calculated by adding the previous two numbers and assigning the result to <code>num3</code>, then updating <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code> accordingly.<br>
        - This continues until the loop completes, producing the Fibonacci sequence up to the desired number of terms.
    </p>
    <p class="example">This simple approach demonstrates how to generate a Fibonacci series using a loop.</p>

    <h2>Code Walkthrough</h2>
    <p>
        - <strong>Initialization:</strong> We start by defining two variables <code>num1 = 0</code> and <code>num2 = 1</code>, which will hold the first two numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.<br>
        - <strong>Loop Iteration:</strong> The loop runs for the specified number of terms. Each time, the value of <code>num1</code> is printed, followed by calculating the next Fibonacci number (<code>num3</code>) as the sum of <code>num1</code> and <code>num2</code>.<br>
        - <strong>Updating Variables:</strong> After printing <code>num1</code>, we update <code>num1</code> to hold the value of <code>num2</code>, and update <code>num2</code> to hold the newly calculated Fibonacci number <code>num3</code>.<br>
        - <strong>Output:</strong> The program prints each Fibonacci number in the sequence until it has printed the desired number of terms, which in this case is 10.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
        The Fibonacci series is a great example for practicing loops and variable management in JavaScript. By iterating through a loop, we are able to generate the sequence step by step. This series appears in various fields, from mathematics to nature, and is used in algorithms, problem-solving, and even in real-world applications.
